## INTRODUCTION

I was asked to write code to encode decimals into a certain hexadecimal string.  I was also asked to write code to decode a hexadecimal string back into a decimal according to a certain bitwise encoding standard.

I wrote the code in Ruby.

I also used Rspec to test my output.

I included a file called `ConvertedData.txt` per the instructions to provide output on certain integers and strings.
## Run

To run the program simply go to the command line and type
`$ ruby code_challenge.rb`


## Testing
In order to test this code take the following steps.

1. open `code_challenge.rb`
2. uncomment line 1 `require 'rspec'`
3. comment line 111 `menu`
4. save
5. `$ rspec`
